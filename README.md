![Intern Us Banner](intern-us-1f3bb9fc/src/assets/Banner.png)

**Intern Us** is a digital-first platform built to **break the “no experience, no job” loop** facing South Africa’s final-year students. We connect universities, students, and employers into a unified ecosystem—designed to make internship discovery, application, placement, and onboarding seamless, inclusive, and impactful.

> 💼 62% of youth aged 15–24 are unemployed.
>  
> 😰 58.7% of them have **no work experience**.
>  
> 🚀 Intern Us fixes that with a platform built for students, not just recruiters.
